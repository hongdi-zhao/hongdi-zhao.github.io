I gave a presentation to my classmates in AEM 7130 Dynamic Optimization class on how to build their own website using GitHub Pages. Since this presentation, I updated my github website and re-build a different website using a much better template.

In case if you would like to build your own website too, please find my presentation slides (step-by-step tutorial) here.
