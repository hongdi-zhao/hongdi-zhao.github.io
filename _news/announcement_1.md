Ph.D. life is not that easy. I am glad my furry friend is here with me: Dr.Qianqian :cat: 

I decide to acknowledge her support by showing you a few photos of her (although she loves her privacy, I think).

<div class="caption">

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/qianqian/qianqian_best_photo.jpeg" title="Qianqian with yellow collar" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

She supports me by sleeping next to my desk when I am struggling with school. Dr. qianqian does not understand why human's have to study hard. She enjoys her best life by sleeping and eating (oh, how could I forget, by talking to me as well because she is super talktive). 
<div class="caption">

</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/qianqian/qianqian_lazy.jpeg" title="Lazy qian" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

If Dr. qianqian has any worries, that must be that she wants her food in the early morning but I usually wake up late. She complains by meowing and showing me her angry:
<div class="caption">
    Qianqian: "Wake up, where is my food?!"

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/qianqian/qianqian_food.jpg" title="Qianqian asks for food" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I am lucy to have her. I wish her always healthy and happy!
