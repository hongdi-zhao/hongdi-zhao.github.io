Hi! I am a Ph.D. Student in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University.
My research interests lie in the fields of applied microeconomics with a focus on economic development and human well-being. I am interested in using Machine Learning as a tool to study economic development. 

See my [publications](/al-folio/publications/) here.
